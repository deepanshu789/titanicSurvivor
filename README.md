Project Name: - 

  Titanic who will survive ML model 

 

Objective: - 

In this project I have made a ml model which predict if a person will survive in the titanic crash or not.  

Dependencies:
1.NumPy
2.Pandas
3.SciKit-Learn
4.Seaborn
5.Matplotlib
 

Detail: -

I have taken the dataset from Kaggle. 

URL - (https://www.kaggle.com/heptapod/titanic). 

This dataset comprises of 891 rows and 13 columns. Then I have made various Comparisions between different attributes by displaying in the for of chart. This tells us about how the survival depends upon different attributes. Then I have various techniques to clean the data by removing any nan values and any outliers effecting our final outcome. At last I have used various types of classifier such as KNeighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVC to predict the outcome. 

Steps: -

  Data Handling
  
    1.Importing Data with Pandas
    2.Cleaning Data
    3.Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
    
  Data Analysis
  
    1.Supervised Machine learning Techniques
    2.KNeighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVC
    3.Plotting graphs

  Valuation of the Analysis
  
    1.K-folds cross validation to valuate results.
    
    
Results: -  

I used various models and got the best result with SVC with a accuracy of 82.93%.
