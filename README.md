Project Name: - 

  Titanic who will survive ML model 

 

Objective: - 

In this project I have made a ml model which predict if a person will survive in the titanic crash or not.  

Dependencies:
1.NumPy
2.Pandas
3.SciKit-Learn
4.Seaborn
5.Matplotlib
 

Steps: - 

I have taken the dataset from Kaggle. 

URL - (https://www.kaggle.com/heptapod/titanic). 

This dataset comprises of 891 rows and 13 columns. Then I have made various Comparisions between different attributes by displaying in the for of chart. This tells us about how the survival depends upon different attributes. Then I have various techniques to clean the data by removing any nan values and any outliers effecting our final outcome. At last I have used various types of classifier such as KNeighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVC   to predict the outcome. 

 

Results: -  

I used various models and got the best result with SVC with a accuracy of 82.93%.
